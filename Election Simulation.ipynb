    "Using the 51 [Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2000) numbers that were used in the 2000 USA Presidential Election, estimate the number of ways there could have been a tie in the 2000 Presidential Election.  Use Monte Carlo simulation (using *iid* Bernoulli (1/2); e.g., a fair coin flip for each state) to simulate many elections. The fraction of elections that end in tie multiplied by the number of possible outcomes is your estimate. The exact answer to this question was determined in 2009 by K. Sigman and O. Watanabe to be 17,150,271,124,366.\n",
